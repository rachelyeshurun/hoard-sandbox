=============

Implementation of a simple Hoard memory allocator in C. Learning exercise.

Warning: This is my homework for Open University of Israel course 'Operating Systems'20594' Autumn 2014/2015. The code is not guaranteed to work - in fact it's not guaranteed to even compile. So **DO NOT COPY!!!**

Please feel free to comment and collaborate to help me learn. That's the point after all.
