hoard-sandbox
=============

Implementation of a simple Hoard memory allocator in C. Learning exercise.

Warning: This is my homework for Open University of Israel course 'Operating Systems'20594' Autumn 2014/2015. The code is not guaranteed to work - in fact it's guaranteed not worth copying - you can write it better!

Please feel free to comment and collaborate to make this code better. That's the point after all.
